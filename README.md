# Build an API in Node.js with Express and Serverless.js

You are provided a JSON file that will act as your database.

Your app will be built to run on the serverless-offline plugin, it will not have to actually run on AWS, only locally.

You will use Postman to test your app.

- You will provide the exported JSON collection file from Postman so others can test your application endpoints.

- You will store it in the `storage` directory.

Your application will:

- Use a JWT to authenticate each API call.
- Use basic authentication to get the JWT.

Your application should:

- At a minimum, demonstrate the use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP calls.
- Use serverless.js, the serverless-offline plugin, and Express.
- Other than that, itâ€™s up to you to come up with the rest.

You will be judged on:

- **_EVERYTHING_**
